🎉 Event Booking Website
This Event Booking Website allows users to browse events, select their preferred one, and complete a booking form. The project focuses on clean UI, smooth animations, and an engaging user experience, including a fun animated robot assistant on the success page.

🧾 Project Description
This project is a front-end based event registration system designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Users can select from multiple events, fill out a registration form, and receive a success confirmation page with animation and a thank-you message.
The system uses LocalStorage to handle temporary booking data, making it simple and lightweight, without needing any backend server.
